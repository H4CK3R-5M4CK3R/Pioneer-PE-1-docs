### FAQ

1. How to read the logs? Reading logs is very easy. Here’s the pattern you should follow:

    - If you selected a single file:
    ```
    File: Filename, PROG: Done : Unable to Process / Total
    ```
    - If you selected a folder:
    ```
    File: Filename, PROG: Done : Unable to Process / Total => files done / total files
    ```
    - Filename: Shows the name of the current file being processed.
    - Done: Displays how much data has been successfully processed.
    - Unable to Process: Shows data the software couldn’t read.
    - Total: Shows the total amount of data in the file (total rows containing addresses).

    - For folder selection:
        - files done: The number of files processed so far.
        - total files: The total number of files in the folder.

This helps you estimate how much data has been processed, how much is remaining, and other relevant details.
